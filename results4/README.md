Centroids over five year time windows for 35 BBS species- routes subsetted as in results2 
(only routes with weather type = 1, at least one data point per five year time window, 
or in a 2 degrees spatial grid with at least one data point per five year time window) AND centroids calculated per species for each BCR first,
then averaged centroid for each species over all BCRs the species is present in.
