# bbs-centroid
Comparison of BBS centroid analysis in Huang et al 2017 Global Change Biology by route instead of by BCR

Outputs of script "script-centroid-analysis.R" found in file results3 (centroid analysis over 5 year time windows for 35 species using all routes from 1969-2016), outputs of scripts "script-clean-bbs-data.R" & "script-bbs-centroid-analysis-revised-dplyr" in results2 (see README in results2 for more stringent route selection criteria)
