Files of the title format "AOU_###_centroid_five_year_windows.csv" contain centroids averaged over five year time windows for each species from 1969-2016

"centroid_abundance_shifts_all_spp.csv" contains result of linear regressions of lat/lon coordinates of centroids over time for each species to determine centroid shift over time

"centroid_shifts_all_spp.csv" contains shift in centroid over the time interval, velocity of shift, bearing of shift direction, and r population change

"direction_abundance_all_species.csv" contains species, AOU, shift distance, shift direction (cardinal- from linear regressions), and abundance shift (from r value)
